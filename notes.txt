-- cloud formation is specific to AWS
-- it is also similar to terraform, but terminologies are more specific to AWS

- Templates are involved (YAML or JSON)
- Cloudformation read template as an input
- Templates describe state of the infra

- A change set allows you to see how changes will impact your existing resources.


- To use these templates go to AWS Cloudformation
- Upload your file either locally or using S3
- Be careful, when updating stacks, some resources are deleted and recreated, which may cause data loss.
- Use change set to avert such cases.
